# Basics
Universe: the set of all possible outcomes
Event: any subset of all possible outcomes

P(E): "The probability of the event E."

# Dependence and Independence
Events E and F are independent if the occurance of the one event does not change the probablity of the occurance of the other event

## Independence
P(E, F) = P(E)P(F)
The probabilty of E and F is the probability of E times the probabilty of F

## Conditional
P(E | F) = P(E, F)/P(F)
The probiability of E given F is the probabilty of E and F divided by the probabilyt of F

## Dependence
P(E, F) = P(E | F)P(F) = P(F | E)P(E)
